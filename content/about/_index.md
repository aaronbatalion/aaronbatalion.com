Aaron has always been fascinated by technology. At 10, he wrote his first line of code. At 22, he earned a degree in computer science. At 23, he led development of Steve Case’s RevolutionHealth (acquired by Everyday Health). At 25, he cofounded Hungry Machine, later known as <a title="LivingSocial" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="livingsocial.com">LivingSocial</a>. In 2015, he became a partner at Lightspeed with a focus on consumer technology.

But Aaron’s career in tech nearly wasn’t. In addition to a degree in computer science, he earned a degree in East Asian philosophy, which, after college, took him to Japan. There, he planned to lead his life as a Buddhist monk.

“But,” he says, “I realized my ADD wouldn’t let me sit still for the next 50 years.”

It turned out to be a good thing. As founder/CTO of one of the first “unicorns,” Aaron helped grow LivingSocial (fka HungryMachine) from four employees in 2007 to more than 4,500 employees in 2011. At its height, the company reached over 80 million consumers, scaled to 25 countries, and hit billions in global sales. Aaron left the company in 2013 and it was acquired by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Groupon" href="groupon.com">Groupon</a> in 2017.

Upon leaving LivingSocial, Aaron was an angel investor and advisor, where he worked closely with 40-plus companies on technology, product, and growth. As a recent founder himself, he realized he wanted to help entrepreneurs full time and joined leading venture capital firm <a title="Lightspeed" rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="lsvp.com">Lightspeed</a> as a Partner, where he led investments in companies like <a title="Reliable Robotics" rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://reliable.co/">Reliable Robotics</a>, an autonomous airplane company founded by veterans of SpaceX, Tesla, and  GoogleX. 

Then in 2018, he left venture capital after realizing he's much happier building new ideas himself than helping others do it from a distance. 

His new company remains in stealth today.
